    // About Us
    <string name="About_Us_main">Living Fruits is a hands-on, family owned and run orchard/business.
        Sue and Murray run the farm and their daughter, Amy, helps out, having recently moved back to Kerikeri with her husband and three children.
        In 2002, we bought our 4.6 Ha block 10 minutes north of Kerikeri and planted our blueberries.
        We love the lifestyle, growing healthy fruit and veg, and its a great place for our children and grandchildren to come home to.</string>
